This website is using github as repository/editor for markdown and uses AWS for distribution using S3/Cloudfront. Github repo has to be public/open if it is not subscribed to paid plans. The other alternative to have private repo was bitbucket or AWS codecommit which supports upto 5 repositories as free.

Early this month github announced  unlimited free private repository with collobarators limited upto 3. Hence moved this repository to private by enabling it from settings.
