Personal/Business hosted email services from  Google Gsuite, Office 365, Amazon workmail etc is default choice for most pro users, the main advantage of these managed email services are large mailbox storage(upto 50G), archive/retention capability and other integrations with third party services. typical costs of these hosted email services are based on monthly rental and other addon features, which gets charged irrespective of actual usage.

What if there is  hosted Email service, dedicated to your domain and gets charged based on actual transaction/storage charges? that should meet the needs of this website, came across this project called [ses-lambda-forwarder](https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder), which is a lambda function and uses inbound/outbound capabilities of AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to run a serverless email forwarding service, details of how to configure it are available with the project itself. 


Though AWS SES is good fit for mostly API based usage (transactional emails,marketing which are triggerd automatically)  and does not have any inbox to check/send emails, when configured with SES rulesets  to store/forward the emails using lambda function, one can get the benefit of unlimited storage (gmail/office provides between 30-50G storage per user) from S3,can be used for analytics ,archival in glacier for any number of years. You gain complete control over the email service/compute/storing those mails

For inbox/composing mails,can continue to use gmail/outlook as client (alias feature of gmail), this is accomplished using smtp credentials of AWS SES, while composing emails..
